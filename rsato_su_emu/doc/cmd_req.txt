Every CDAS-> UB request is going to have the following format:

Preamble(n),
L,type,Id(2),# of mess,ignored(4),
Dest,
nst,
st1(2),
st2(2),
...
(length,compl/slice,type,mess/version) - 4 bytes in total
part of the message itself
CRC(4),
ETX(1=0xFF).

Therefore, it follows almost the same structure as the UB->CDAS communication
data stream, but it has a small modification due to "Destination" and station
list.

The COMMS type is "D"(0x44) and the type of the T3 request is 0x07.

The message of the T3 request would follow:

IdT3 (2 bytes)
second (4 bytes - most significant byte first)
usecond (4 bytes - the same)
list of offset and windown (one byte for each one) each pair would be
for the number of stations.

===========
The destination, use just the 2 most significant bits which would 
have one of the following options:

0 -> single (the two bytes which follows the destination byte, is the station Id)
3 -> broadcast - followed by the message ...
1 -> station list - (follow 1 byte for the number of stations and stations Id)
2 -> anti list. - similar to the "1".
